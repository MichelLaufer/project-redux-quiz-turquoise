# Redux quiz group project

This week's project at the Technigo boot camp was to work in teams to build a quiz game using React.js and Redux.
The project was made during a two-day meetup in Stockholm. 

Tech:
<br>React, Redux, JavaScript(ES6), CSS, HTML</br>

My team chose to create a quiz on capital cities in Europe with five multiple-choice questions. We created several
components and had several reducers and actions that we dispatched. We used the global state to render the quiz questions one at a time and the answer alternatives. The user has to choose an answer alternative to be able to go to the next question.
